# EOF
 Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of global SST

The method of Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis involves decomposing a signal or data set using orthogonal basis functions determined from the data. This process is similar  to performing a principal components analysis on the data, with the key distinction that the EOF method identifies both temporal projections and spatial patterns. In earthsciences, this term is interchangeable with geographically weighted PCAs. The spatial patterns represent the EOFs, functioning as basis functions in terms of variance. The corresponding temporal projections are the Principal Components (PCs), serving as the temporal coefficients for the EOF patterns.
